## Functional Programming
### Elements of functional languages 
***

#### When is a programming language considered functional ?

* When functions are treated as first class values / objects, just like any other variable
* When functions can be defined and stored in variables
* When functions can be passed as parameters to other functions, just like we pass other primitive types and objects like Integer, Float etc
* When functions can be returned as values from other functions, just like we return other primitive types and objects
* When functions can be created inside other functions, just like local variables can be created inside other functions
* When functions can be defined without giving them a name ( anonymous functions ), with the ability to define function literals just like integer literals
* When function calls have no side effects, they take some arguments as inputs and return results. For the same input, they always return the same output, a characteristic known as Referential Transparency, which means that the function / method call can always be replaced with the output returned, without changing the program semantics
